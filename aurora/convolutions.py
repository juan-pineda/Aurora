convolutions
============

This module contains the methods in charge of constructing the PSF and LSF to
recreate the spatial and spectral resolution, respectively, with normalized Gaussian kernels. It also contains the methods that apply the spectral and
spatial convolutions.

Notes
-----
The only convolution not found in this module is the analytical spectral
convolution stored in the spectrum_tools.py module.
