===========================
Input parameters:
===========================

Aurora loads the input parameters sequentially, and checks for self
consistency among them. Note that this may push aurora to ignore some
values from the ConfigFile and/or to set them by itself.

The highest hierarchy parameter is redshift, and in general those
quantities expressed in physical units are given priority.

For example, if a given pixsize in kpc is provided Aurora will compute
the corresponding spatial_sampl in arcsec as a function of the angular
distance, d_theta.
Yet if no pixsize was passed in the ConfigFile, Aurora will try to
determine it in the inverse way, i.e., using the value of spatial_sampl.

The nested algorithm to define the value to use for each parameter is
presented below. Exact constants and unit information is ommited in
this summary.

Case 1: If a redshift was specified.
===========================================

redshift ?	
		yes: lambda_em, d_theta, and dl are determined from Cosmology
		not: load lambda_em, d_theta, or set them to NaN if they are missing
			 load dl, or set it to 1/sqrt{4.pi} if it is missing

pixsize ?
		yes: sets spatial_sampl = pixsize/d_theta
		not:
			spatial_sampl ?
					yes: sets pixsize
					not: Both parameters are set to NaN

spatial_res_kpc ?
		yes: sets spatial_res = spatial_res_kpc/d_theta
        not: 
			spatial_res ?
					yes: sets spatial_res_kpc
					not: Both parameters are set to NaN

fieldofview ?
		yes: set FoV_arcsec = fieldofview/d_theta
			 set spatial_dim = fieldofview/spatial_sampl
		not:
			FoV_arcsec ?
					yes: set fieldofview and spatial_dim
					not:
						spatial_dim ?
								yes: set fieldofview and FoV_arcsec
								not: The three parameters are set to NaN

spectral_res?
		yes: no dependencies associated
		not:
			it is set to NaN

velocity_sampl ?
		yes: set spectral_sampl = lambda_em*velocity_sampl/c
		not:
			spectral_sampl ?
					yes: sets velocity_sampl
					not: Both parameters are set to NaN

velocity_range ?
		yes: set spectral_range = lambda_em * velocity_range/c
			 set spectral_dim = velocity_range/velocity_sampl
		not:
			spectral_range ?
					yes: set velocity_range and spectral_dim
					not: 
						spectral_dim ?
								yes: set velocity_range and spectral_range
								not: The three parameters are set to NaN


When all the parameters in a given set of 2 or 3 entangled elements are
missing, Aurora set them to NaN and raise a warning message, not trying
to find out their values from other informations.

Depending on what you are doing this will
likely cause termination or unexpected results, so, make sure that you
are feeding Aurora what it needs for your specific purpose.

The only default value which does not go to NaN is dl = 1/sqrt{4.pi}.
This means that Aurora will compute the total intrinsic luminosities
instead of the incoming flux at Earth, as Flux = Lum. / (4.pi.dl^2).
